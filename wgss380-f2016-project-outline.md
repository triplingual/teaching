Digital Street Project Outline
==============================

The digital street project will be in the form of an actual street,
digitally represented, somewhere other than here, some other time than
now. Due before lab on the dates indicated:

1.  **4 October (week 5): Identify the street, time, and issues.** 500–1250 words explaining your reasoning behind these selections.
1.  **18 October (week 7): Rough design proposal 1, with media.** 500–1250 words plus 5–10 pieces of media showing and justifying your current digital street planned look, feel, and operation. This assignment should be seen as the minimum representation of what you hope the final project will be.
1.  **1 November (week 9): Refined/revised design proposal 2, with refined/revised media and archiving proposal.** 250–750 words plus 5–10 (new) pieces of media discussing how your research and designing has refined or changed since week 7.
1.  **29 November and 6 December (weeks 12 and 13): Presentation/critique.**
1.  **16 December (first day of final exams): Reflection paper and project submission.** Deposit an electronic version of your project, including a 500–1000 word paper reflecting on the project process, your technological processes, and your entanglement in the theoretical issues raised in the course in your ClassesV2 Dropbox. If your project lives on the open (or semi-open) web, that location will be the version for evaluation, but you must also submit something that can be archived per the week 9 milestone.

Projects will be evaluated on the following criteria:
-----------------------------------------------------

1.  **Theoretical**: How strong are the ideas guiding the work?
1.  **Technical**: How well was the piece put together? (Balanced against the difficulty of the platforms used.)
1.  **Aesthetic**: How aesthetically consonant is the piece with the issues addressed? (Based on the project's concept, it might be appropriate to make the work “beautiful”, “ugly”, or some reconfiguration of those notions, and the appropriateness of the aesthetic to the issues will form the base of this portion of the grade.)
1.  **Alignment**: Does the final work line up with your intentions?
